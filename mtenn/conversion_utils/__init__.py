"""
Subpackage where the implementations for individual models live. Each module in here
should have a class that handles the logic for constructing ``Representation`` and
``Strategy`` blocks for that model. For more information on how this works and how to
add your own model, see our guides on :ref:`new-installable-model-guide` and
:ref:`new-non-installable-model-guide`.
